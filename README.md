## Controls

Trigger button -> Grab from far with the ray

Grab button -> Grab close when the controller is over the ball

Left joystick -> Movement

## To improve

Movement is still giving motion sickness pretty fast. Using an acceleration curve could be part of the solution

Depending on the type of game, ball shot could be more guided and use the rim position to improve player precision

Scoring : it's possible to score by putting your hand in the rim from under and releasing the ball after, might need to find a fix here.
Could also add a distance condition for different amount of point
